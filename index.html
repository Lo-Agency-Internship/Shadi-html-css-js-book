        <h2 id="Question1">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p class="Qp">HTML (stands for Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language for the web that defines the
            structure of web pages.It tells the browser how to interpret data to form elements on a website.
            HTML elements consists of the opening tag, a character, the content, and a
            closing tag.</p>
        <h2 id="Question2">What is a basic structure of an HTML document?</h2>
        <ul class="Q-ul">
            <li><b>DOCTYPE:</b>
                <p>This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is
                    HTML 5.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>HTML:</b>
                <p>This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Head:</b>
                <p>This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, Title of the
                    page, version of HTML, Meta Data etc.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Body:</b>
                <p>This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page. Body tag is used to
                    enclose all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All the content that
                    you see rendered in the browser is contained within this element. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Question3">What are the tags/elements that you've learned so far?</h2>
        <p> HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets.thee tags that I have
            learned are as below:</p>
        <ul class="Q-ul">
            <li><strong>&lt p &gt</strong> : The p element lets you create paragraphs of text.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt h &gt</strong> : HTML actually supports 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5,
                and h6. h1 is for the most important headings, h2 is for less important subheadings, and
                so on. </li>
            <li><strong>&lt a &gt</strong> : One of the most important elements in a web page, the a element
                lets
                you create links to other content. The content can be either on your own site or on another
                site.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt img &gt</strong> : The img element lets you insert images into your web pages. To
                insert an image, you first upload the image to your web server, then use an img tag to reference
                the uploaded image filename.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt div &gt</strong>: The div element is a generic container that you can use to add
                more structure to your page content.</li>
            <li><strong>&lt span &gt</strong>: The span element is similar to div in that itâ€™s used to add
                structure to your content. The difference is that div is a block-level element, while span is an
                inline element.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="Question3-1">How are they written?</h2>
        <p class="Qp">HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets <strong> &lt;</strong>
            <strong>
                &gt;</strong> symbol </p>
        <h2 id="Question3-2">What are their important attributes?</h2>

        <h2 id="Question3-3"> How can they be used?</h2>
